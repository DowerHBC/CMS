### Minimal installation

While installing the entire package manually or with composer is simple, convenient and reliable, you may want to include only vital files in your project. At the very least you will need [class.phpmailer.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/class.phpmailer.php). If you're using SMTP, you'll need [class.smtp.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/class.smtp.php), and if you're using POP-before SMTP, you'll need [class.pop3.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/class.pop3.php). For all of these, we recommend you use [the autoloader](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/PHPMailerAutoload.php) too as otherwise you will either have to `require` all classes manually or use some other autoloader. You can skip the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder if you're not showing errors to users and can make do with English-only errors. You may need the additional classes in the [extras](extras/) folder if you are using those features, including NTLM authentication and ics generation. If you're using Google XOAUTH2 you will need `class.phpmaileroauth.php` and `class.oauth.php` classes too, as well as the composer dependencies.

## Documentation

Examples of how to use PHPMailer for common scenarios can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder. If you're looking for a good starting point, we recommend you start with [the Gmail example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples/gmail.phps).

There are tips and a troubleshooting guide in the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki). If you're having trouble, this should be the first place you look as it's the most frequently updated.

Complete generated API documentation is [available online](http://phpmailer.github.io/PHPMailer/).

You'll find some basic user-level docs in the [docs](docs/) folder, and you can generate complete API-level documentation using the [generatedocs.sh](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/docs/generatedocs.sh) shell script in the docs folder, though you'll need to install [PHPDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org) first. You may find [the unit tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/test/phpmailerTest.php) a good source of how to do various operations such as encryption.

If the documentation doesn't cover what you need, search the [many questions on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpmailer), and before you ask a question about "SMTP Error: Could not connect to SMTP host.", [read the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting).

## Security

Please disclose any vulnerabilities found responsibly - report any security problems found to the maintainers privately.

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.22 (released January 9th 2017) have a local file disclosure vulnerability, [CVE-2017-5223](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5223). If content passed into `msgHTML()` is sourced from unfiltered user input, relative paths can map to absolute local file paths and added as attachments. Also note that `addAttachment` (just like `file_get_contents`, `passthru`, `unlink`, etc) should not be passed user-sourced params either! Reported by Yongxiang Li of Asiasecurity.

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.20 (released December 28th 2016) are vulnerable to [CVE-2016-10045](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-10045) a remote code execution vulnerability, responsibly reported by [Dawid Golunski](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10045-Vuln-Patch-Bypass.html), and patched by Paul Buonopane (@Zenexer).

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.18 (released December 2016) are vulnerable to [CVE-2016-10033](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-10033) a critical remote code execution vulnerability, responsibly reported by [Dawid Golunski](http://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html).

See [SECURITY](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/SECURITY.md) for more detail on security issues.

## Contributing

Please submit bug reports, suggestions and pull requests to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/issues).

We're particularly interested in fixing edge-cases, expanding test coverage and updating translations.

With the move to the PHPMailer GitHub organisation, you'll need to update any remote URLs referencing the old GitHub location with a command like this from within your clone:

```sh
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer.git
```

Please *don't* use the SourceForge or Google Code projects any more.
